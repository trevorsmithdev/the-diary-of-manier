Don't listen to me.

Seriously, I don't know what I'm doing. Rather, I hope this diary will serve as an example of how NOT to do things when it comes to making gold in Classic World of Warcraft. Sometimes knowning what not to do is infinitely more useful than trying to discern the "right" thing to do.

I should also clarify that when I say "gold" I really do mean "gold, silver, and copper" because, when you're getting started, every little bit counts. I used to sell Weak Troll's Blood potions for a profit of 1 silver. For a brand new Classic character, that's a lot of money! No matter what scale you're working with, gold-making in WoW can be a very engaging enterprise...assuming your definition of "engaging" includes spending a lot of time configuring TSM in menus. For me, the configuration _is_ the fun, and the gold I accumlate is really just a measure of how well I configured.

Sometimes I configure very badly and lose a lot of gold. That's okay! It's fake money in the recreation of a 15-year-old game - the stakes are pretty low here. I have invested a lot of time learning what does and doesn't work, and that learning process is what makes this particular aspect of WoW so engaging for me. There's a lot to learn, and I hope I've at least peaked your interest long enough to stick around for what's to come.

But first, a cautionary tale....
